## 2026-02-27 -- Environment Setup

### Issue1
Running:
    psql --version

Error:
    'psql' is not recognized as an internal or external command

### Root Cause
PostgreSQL was installed, but the `bin` directory was not added to the Windows PATH environment variable.

### Fix
1. Located:
   C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin
2. Added that path to:
   System Environment Variables → Path
        Press Windows key
        Search: Environment Variables
        Click: Edit the system environment variables
        Click: Environment Variables
        Under System variables, select Path
        Click Edit
        Click New
        Paste:C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin
3. Restarted Command Prompt
4. Verified with:

    psql --version

Output:
    psql (PostgreSQL) 18.1

### Learning
- Installing software ≠ CLI accessible
- Windows PATH configuration is critical
- Always verify client tools before designing schema

Status: ✅ Resolved
