# 2026-02-28 – Project Structuring & Governance Setup

## Duration
~1 hour

## Objective
Establish professional project structure and development discipline for GrihaLedger.

---

## Work Completed

- Finalized project name: **GrihaLedger**
- Defined project positioning as a fintech SaaS-style data platform
- Created structured repository layout:
  - src/
  - sql/
  - tests/
  - docs/
  - scripts/
- Established development discipline guidelines
- Defined commit message standard (Conventional Commits)
- Defined single-branch policy (main must always remain runnable)
- Defined execution tracking approach:
  - Google Sheet for time & gap detection
  - GitHub commits as proof of work

---

## Decisions Locked

- March 2026 focus: Core transactional system only
- No Docker, dbt, or Airflow in Phase 1
- System must remain runnable at all times
- Minimum 3 commits per week
- Daily execution logging mandatory

---

## Observations

- Clear project identity improves seriousness.
- Early governance reduces future chaos.
- Structure before scale.

---

## Next Steps

- Connect to PostgreSQL server (`psql -U postgres`)
- Create raw schema
- Begin table creation (households, members, accounts, transactions)

Status: In Progress
